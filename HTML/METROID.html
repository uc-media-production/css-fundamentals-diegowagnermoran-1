                    <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
                </div>
                <p>The Metroid games are set in the same universe. They share most main characters and gameplay elements, with a few notable exceptions.</p>
                <p>Samus Aran, the main character and heroine, is a bounty hunter, though in Metroid she was known as a "space hunter". She wears an extremely powerful and adaptable exoskeleton known as the Power Suit, which was made for her by the ancient Chozo</p>
                <p>The Metroids are large, jellyfish-like creatures with several visible nuclei. They are capable of absorbing the life energy from any living organism, generally causing the death of the victim in the process. Metroid II: Return of Samus established a five-stage life cycle in which the Metroids native to SR388 go through two stages of ecdysis followed by two stages of mutation, thus maturing through four forms: Alpha, Gamma, Zeta, and Omega. Metroid Prime introduced two new forms: Hunter Metroids, which sport tentacles enabling long-range energy siphoning; and the Phazon-mutated Fission Metroids, which divide into two new Fission Metroids after absorbing a certain amount of energy. Prime and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes also have an adapted subspecies of Metroids, known as the Tallon Metroid. Instead of absorbing all of their power from victims, they can feed directly off Phazon. They are born as Infant Metroids from cocoons and mature into adulthood when exposed to Phazon. Echoes also introduces Dark Tallon Metroids, Tallon Metroids corrupted by the Ing.</p>
                <p>The main villains of many of the Metroid games are the Space Pirates. Mother Brain is the biomechanical organism that controls the defenses of the planet Zebes. Kraid appears as an important boss in Metroid, Metroid: Zero Mission, and Super Metroid. Ridley, a leader of the Space Pirates and Samus' archnemesis, appears in Metroid, Super Metroid, Metroid Fusion, Metroid: Zero Mission, Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, and Metroid: Other M. The organization also includes a winged, mantis-like species, the Kihunters. The Space Pirates are very interested in Metroid research, especially in using Metroids for energy generation or as bioweapons. Their Phazon experiments produced many of the Metroid variants seen in the Prime games.</p>
                <p>Another important organization is the Galactic Federation, which was formed force to keep the galaxy at peace while eliminating the Space Pirate threat. However, they have begun showing signs of corruption prior to Metroid: Other M and Metroid Fusion, initially creating bioweapons for military applications, which was strictly forbidden.</p>
                <div class="overviewtext">
                    <h1>GAMEPLAY</h1>
                </div>
                    <p>The gameplay of all Metroid games revolves around Samus collecting items or power-ups that give her the ability to overcome obstacles. Many of the items recur throughout the series with some modifications, such as the Morph Ball, which allows her to curl into a small ball to access tight spaces and drop Bombs. Despite the series having a chronological element to it, each game requires the acquisition of the upgrades. For instance, Metroid Prime occurs after the first Metroid, though Samus starts with the same minimal gear.</p>
                    <p>The main enemies of the games in the Metroid series are divided into two groups: bosses and final bosses. Each game contains multiple bosses that are often encountered by entering a large sealed room and engaging in combat with a large creature. When successful, the room opens and allows further progress, usually rewarding Samus with an item in the process. Final bosses are found at the end of each Metroid game, and usually consist of a fight similar to a normal boss followed by a timed dash back to Samus's Gunship to complete the game. In Metroid Prime, however, unlike many Metroid games, Samus only dashes back to her Gunship at the beginning of the game, though she does lose several power-ups along the way. In Metroid II and Metroid: Samus Returns, there is no countdown at all.</p>
                    <p>In Metroid and Super Metroid, Kraid and Ridley make appearances as bosses, with Mother Brain as a final boss. In some of the games, a Metroid in some form can take the role of a boss, and sometimes even a final boss. The combat model for bosses and final bosses is usually the same, though there are a some exceptions throughout the series.</p>
                    <p>The Metroid Prime titles diverge from the typical gameplay of the series by presenting the game through Samus's point of view. As a result, the Prime titles contain many first-person shooter elements while retaining the sense of exploration and item collection from the 2D series. An additional element present in the Prime series is the ability to scan creatures and objects to obtain information about them.</p>
                    <p>Metroid Prime Hunters focuses on Samus's talents with her arm cannon by only having weapon upgrades obtainable.</p>
                    <p>Metroid Prime 3: Corruption focuses on a new Hypermode system where Samus becomes extremely powerful at the price of an energy tank.</p>
