                </div>
                <p>Mario (or Super Mario) is a long-running media franchise developed and produced by Nintendo. The titular character of the franchise is Mario, a fictional Italian plumber who serves as the hero of a place called the Mushroom Kingdom. The franchise was started by game designer Shigeru Miyamoto, with the first installment being Mario Bros., a Game & Watch game released in early 1983, with an arcade version following shortly after. The predecessor franchise to Mario is Donkey Kong, which had its first installment, Donkey Kong, released on July 9, 1981 for arcade systems.</p>
                <p>The games were primarily developed and self-published internally by Nintendo, while other companies such as Hudson Soft, Square Enix, AlphaDream, Retro Studios, and several more, developed Mario games under Nintendo's supervision. Beginning with third-generation consoles onward, most installments in the series have been developed for various Nintendo game systems and handhelds.</p>
                <p>The Super Mario series is the main one of the franchise, consisting of platformer titles that usually revolve around Mario and Luigi protecting the Mushroom Kingdom and Princess Peach from Bowser and his Koopa Troop. Both brothers make use of their trademark jumping ability that effectively allows them to proceed through levels, and are also able to acquire a variety of useful power-ups. The franchise also consists of other genres which include racing games such as the Mario Kart series, sports such as Mario Tennis, role-playing games (RPG) such as the Mario & Luigi series, and several educational games.</p>
                <p>The Mario franchise totals over 200 video games, with a combined selling of over 600 million copies. Mario also has appearances in other media such as comics, television series, books, and a feature film. Being the flagship franchise of Nintendo, Mario has garnered massive critical acclaim and is highly recognized worldwide as the best-selling franchise.</p>

                <p>The Mario series began in 1981 with Donkey Kong. Created by Shigeru Miyamoto, Donkey Kong was Nintendo's first big success. Originally, Mario was known as Jumpman, but it was later changed to the former when Nintendo of America nicknamed the character Mario after their landlord, Mario Segale.</p>
                <p>Mario returned to the series as the villain of Donkey Kong Jr. However, he was replaced by Stanley the Bugman in Donkey Kong 3.</p>
